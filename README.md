# MVQAR-MIDAS (Devan's Code for Patrick)

- `run_interactive.R` allows for simulating and plotting a single data set.
- `run_simstudy.R` will run 1000 simulations and compare the estimates with the true value.
	- Because of the penalization of the theta values, the estimates are quite clearly biased!
